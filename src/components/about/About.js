        In a world with everything shouting for your attention, the disciplined
        pursuit of less has never been more needed. Enter Essentialism. The Way
        of the Essentialist involves doing less, but better, so you can make the
        highest possible contribution. It’s not about getting more done in less
        time or getting less done. It’s about getting only the right things
        done. It’s about regaining control of our own choices about where to
        spend our time and energies instead of giving others implicit permission
        to choose for us. The first step to essentialism is identifying your
        values.
